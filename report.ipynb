    "# Report machine learning project : football match prediction\n",
    "**Authors**: Arradi Naoufal, Bienfait Méo, Bouchakour Younes, Sergent Pierre-Louis, Tadjer Badr\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subject\n",
    "\n",
    "For our machine learning class we had to do a project. We decided to choose a subject that was interesting for everyone, since the majority of our group was into football we decided to find a problematic around this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two ideas were:\n",
    "- predicting future football games results\n",
    "- predicting football games results based on stats\n",
    "\n",
    "The first subject appeared to be more complicated, both in terms of data gathering with different type of data (form of players, roaster of the game, previous game stats of the season) and data analysis with several dataset to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereby we chose the second topic. The idea would be to use supervised algorithms with game stats of passed matches, and then try to determine the winners/losers of other games. We could then assess which metric has the most influence on the results and **establish the best scenario to win a football game**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking for datasets online we thought it would be more useful to use an API instead. This way we have more control on our data and we can also extend our dataset at will by adding more season stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we used the API of [Sportmonks](https://www.sportmonks.com/) as it provided the necessary data with enough free calls per hour (180) to play around with the data. The code written to extract the data from the API is accessible in [this files](https://github.com/PLsergent/football_match_prediction/blob/main/sport_monks_api.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can use the class `SportmonksAPI(season_id: int, league_id: int)` that will get all the stats of all games for a given season and league. The attribute `rows_data` will then contain a list of list of game stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shots**:\n",
    "- total\n",
    "- ongoal\n",
    "- offgoal\n",
    "- insidebox\n",
    "- outsidebox\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passes**:\n",
    "- total\n",
    "- percentage(of completed pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attacks**:\n",
    "- total\n",
    "- dangerous\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others**:\n",
    "- Fouls\n",
    "- Corners\n",
    "- Possession_time\n",
    "- Yellow_cards\n",
    "- Red_cards\n",
    "- Saves\n",
    "- Substitutions\n",
    "- Tackles\n",
    "- Penalties\n",
    "- Injuries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: win = 1, draw = 0, loss = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game stats pre processing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Included in the python code.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have relevant data for our model, we will get all the stats for every game in a season, and then we will compare the two teams of each match by subtracting their stats to one another. Hence we can keep track of the dominance of each team in specific areas. Indeed we thought that the stats themselves would not be sufficient to train our model as we would lose the sense of \"confrontation\" between two teams. A team could win a game with 400 passes but lose the next game with the same amount of passes. A stat is relevant only when compared to the opposing team.\n",
    "\n",
    "So **each line** of our dataset represent in reality **the team stats minus the opposing team stats for this game**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "||round|passes|shots|attacks|penalties|red_cards|output|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|team a|1|200|3|10|0|0|1|\n",
    "|team b|1|-200|-3|-10|0|0|-1|\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the *team a* did 200 **more** passes than his opponent, and had 3 **more** shots.\n",
    "The *team b* did 200 **less** passes than his opponent, and had 3 **less** shots.\n",
